# Survey Form

This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge and marks the first project of the journey. The goal of this project is to create a survey form that fulfills specific user stories and requirements, providing a simple and effective way to gather user input.

## Overview

The Survey Form Project is designed to be functionally similar to the example provided by freeCodeCamp but with a personal touch and unique styling. It includes all required form elements to collect user data such as name, email, number, and additional comments, along with options for dropdowns, radio buttons, and checkboxes.




## Features

- HTML5 Validation: Ensures correct input format for email and number fields.
- Dynamic Input Types: Includes text, email, number, select dropdown, radio buttons, checkboxes, and textarea.
- User-Friendly Design: Clear labels and placeholders guide users through the form.
